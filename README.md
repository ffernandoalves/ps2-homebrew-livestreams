# P2Garage Library

Playstation 2 Homebrew for Humans

## What It Is 

This is a library for creating interactive media on the Playstation 2. 

## What This Is Not

P2Garage is _NOT_ a fully featured game engine. This library does a lot to simplify building PS2 software.
It has a lot of useful abstractions, makes graphics nice and has a lot of useful utilities. The library does
not have strong opinions on how to build a game.
